#StillCam - Still & Camera for Android mobile platforms

Still Camera is an Android application design for photography usage which has the following features:
*FlashLight ON/OFF - in order to take beautiful photos you also need a certain amount of good light. If the Camera sensor doesn't have enough power to compensate the environment light, the flash will take place and fill the whole scenery with light
*Show Device rotation - this is a main feature because the main purpose of this Camera application was to show if the Preview image is still before is taken. The app uses the Accelerometer sensor feature in order to show how accurate the user holds his smartphone. This is where the idea of "StillCam" was born in the first place
*Gallery button to show your captured images but this feature will be implemented soon
More extra features will be added in the future. So please stay tuned!
