## StillCam - Still & Camera Application for Android mobile devices

## About:
Still Camera is an Android application designed for photography purposes to take nice and still pictures. It is a basic Camera API interface application.

## Features:
- FlashLight - in order to take beautiful photos you also need a certain amount of good light. If the Camera sensor doesn't have enough power to compensate the environment light, the flash will take place and fill the whole scenery with light
- Show Device rotation - this is a main feature because the main purpose of this Camera application was to show if the Preview image is still before is taken. The app uses the Accelerometer sensor feature in order to show how accurate the user holds his smartphone. This is where the idea of "StillCam" was born in the first place.
- Gallery - used to show your captured images but this feature will be implemented soon

## Instructions:
Step 1. Install the apk file downloaded on your mobile device
Step 2. Now you need to go to your device Settings -> Apps(Application list) -> StillCam -> Grant permissions for 'Camera' and 'Storage'
After you installed the app, enter and you will see the following:
- A red camera icon in the center of the layout. You will press this button to snap your picture
- A flash on/off button on the left. This will trigger your flashlight state to ON or OFF
- A gallery green icon(not yet implemented) this will show your images in a list view
- A text view showing the Yaw Rotation of your device on the 'z axis' (same as a Bubble Leveler)

## Note:
THe captured image is storage on your external SD card path
More extra features (for example Autofocus) will be added in the future. So please stay tuned!
